*Note from the author*. ESEA Outdoors UK started off as a question: is there anyone else that looks like me out there in the outdoors? In our first full year of existence, we have shown that we can build a community of ESEA people in the outdoors, and that our representation matters to our members and to society. We can only capture a fraction of this joy in numbers and words. I hope that, while reading this impact report, you will agree that it is not an understatement to say that we have transformed members' lives.

**ESEA Outdoors UK is a community connecting East & Southeast Asian outdoor enthusiasts across the UK and celebrating our representation.**

### What members say...

> Throughout the weekend, I could finally stop searching, to stop thinking I was the problem. That there was somewhere I could finally let my guard down, somewhere I belonged. That I didn't have to mould myself into places that didn't have a space *(after our October Lake District trip)*

> Up on these familiar fells where I find solace, I realise that only by tackling our underrepresentation have I finally gained a sense of belonging here. *(after Great Lakeland 3 Day)*

> When you see 14 others that look like you in a field of 800, you feel less out of place.

> There is great value in braving the wild. But sometimes, it gets isolating. You long for familiarity. And so you seek comfort in shared values and cultures in a space so integral to your identity. *(after our October Lake District trip)*

> It is a wonderful thing to celebrate the rich diversity and histories among the ESEA community. Many of us have roots around the globe, being part of families who have migrated far and wide for myriad reasons. Some of us have moved from our homelands, some of us never knew our homelands. *(after our Roots/Routes walk in Walthamstow for ESEA Heritage Month)*

> Every time I come to the fells I absorb casually racist remarks; I've developed resilience, but it still hurts. This weekend, in a group, it feels safe, like I could put my guard down for a bit. *(after Great Lakeland 3 Day)*

> ...It really highlighted the necessity of groups like ours \[after\] coming across a few occasions of racism and microaggressions. *(after our October trip to YHA Cheddar)*

> I grew up on a mountain; thousands of miles away, I feel like I'm home yet again. *(after Great Lakeland 3 Day)*

> Community groups exist to create safe spaces. They exist to support people in accessing the outdoors. They exist to rebel. To challenge the status quo. *(ESEA Outdoors member)*
